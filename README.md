# Gat201_Cfu_Assay
 Cfu assay for WT, Gat201 deletion, Complemented clones C26 and C30

I have collated OD measurements and average cell counts (from Cfu assays).

31-10-2022 Comparison of growth of H99 and Gat 201 mutant (003; Madhan) and 2 Gat201 complemented strains into the Madhani deletion background in RPMI and RPMI + Serum (10% FBS) at 37 degrees over a 60 hour time course. 

Samples were collected at 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours post inoculation into fresh media.
A 1:10 deletion series was carries out from neat to 10e-4. 100 microlitres of dilutions 10e3 and 10e4 were plated out onto YMD Agar, incubated for 48 hours and colonies counted.

The average of cells/ml over the 2 deletions were used as input for the data analysis.
